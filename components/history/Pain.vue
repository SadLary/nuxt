            The LASIK surgeon uses computer software to guide the IntraLase laser beam, which applies a series of tiny
            (3-micron-diameter) bubbles within the central layer of the cornea.
          </p>

          <p>
            The resulting corneal flap is created at a precise depth and diameter pre-determined by the surgeon. As
            occurs with a mechanical microkeratome, a small section of tissue at one edge of the flap is left uncut,
            forming a hinge that allows the surgeon to fold back the flap so that the cornea can be accessed and
            reshaped for vision correction.
