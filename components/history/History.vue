            The LASIK surgeon uses computer software to guide the IntraLase laser beam, which applies a series of tiny

            The resulting corneal flap is created at a precise depth and diameter pre-determined by the surgeon. As occurs
            with a mechanical microkeratome, a small section of tissue at one edge of the flap is left uncut, forming a
            hinge that allows the surgeon to fold back the flap so that the cornea can be accessed and reshaped for vision
            correction.
